{asterisk} Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP uses Autonomous Ransomware Protection (ARP) and not ARP/AI.

[NOTE]
Using ARP/AI in ONTAP requires ONTAP 9.16 or greater. +
ONTAP doesn't provide ransomware protection support for FlexGroup volumes, mount point volumes, mount path volumes, offline volumes, and Data protection (DP) volumes.
