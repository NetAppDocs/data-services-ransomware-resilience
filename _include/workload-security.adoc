[NOTE]
If you're already using NetApp Data Infrastructure Insights (DII) Workload Security, it's recommended you use the same Workload Security agents for Ransomware Resilience. You don't need to deploy separate Workload Security agents for Ransomware Resilience, however, using the same Workload Security agents requires a pairing relationship between the Ransomware Resilience Console organization and DII Storage Workload Security tenant. Contact your account representative to enable this pairing. +
To use suspicious user detection _without_ DII, ensure you've link:suspicious-user-activity.html[enabled suspicious user activity detection] and have configured the appropriate agents.
