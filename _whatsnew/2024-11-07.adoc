=== Enable data classification and scan for personally identifiable information (PII)
With this release, you can enable BlueXP classification, a core component of the BlueXP family, to scan and classify data in your file share workloads. Classifying data helps you identify whether your data includes personal or private information, which can increase security risks. This process also impacts workload importance and helps you ensure that you are protecting workloads with the right level of protection. 

Scanning for PII data in BlueXP ransomware protection is generally available to customers who deployed BlueXP classification. BlueXP classification is available as part of the BlueXP platform at no extra charge and can be deployed on-premises or in the customer cloud. 

//BlueXP classification can be also deployed as a SaaS model as part of a Technology Preview. To enable Preview features, use the BlueXP ransomware protection *Settings* option. If you enable Preview, a "Preview" label appears next to the *Privacy exposure* column on the Protection page along with other locations.

To initiate scanning, on the Protection page, click *Identify exposure* in the Privacy exposure column.

=== Free trial now 30 days
With this release, new deployments of BlueXP ransomware protection now have 30 days for a free trial. Previously, BlueXP ransomware protection provided 90 days as a free trial. If you are already in the 90-day free trial, that offer continues for the 90 days. 

=== Restore application workload at the file level for Podman
Before you restore an application workload at the file level, you can now view a list of files that might have been impacted by an attack and identify those you want to restore. Previously, if the BlueXP Connectors in an organization (previously an account) were using Podman, this feature was disabled. It is now enabled for Podman. You can let BlueXP ransomware protection choose the files to restore, you can upload a CSV file that lists all the files impacted by an alert, or you can manually identify which files you want to restore.
