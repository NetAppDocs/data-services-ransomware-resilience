=== Detect malicious activity 

Triggered by the Autonomous Ransomware Protection feature in ONTAP, BlueXP ransomware protection helps you detect malicious activity based on the behavior of the files in the volume:  

* Entropy of incoming data
* Expected creation rate of new files compared to detected rate
* Expected deletion rate of files compared to detected rate
* Expected rename rate of files compared to detected rate

When malicious activity occurs, an alert is generated and an automated snapshot is taken.

=== Detect anomalous user behavior using Data Infrastructure Insights Storage Workload Security

With this release, you can use Data Infrastructure Insights Storage Workload Security to detect anomalous user behavior in your storage workloads. This feature helps you identify potential security threats and block potentially malicious users to protect your data.

Before you use Data Infrastructure Insights Storage Workload Security to detect anomalous user behavior, you need to configure the option by using the BlueXP ransomware protection *Settings* option.

=== Select workloads to discover and protect

With this release, you can now do the following: 

* Within each Connector, select the working environments where you want to discover workloads. You might benefit from this feature if you want to protect specific workloads in your environment and not others. 
* During workload discovery, you can enable automatic discovery of workloads per Connector. This feature lets you select the workloads that you want to protect. 
* Discover newly created workloads for previously selected working environments.

//=== Configure cyber vault
// With this release, you can lock immutable and indelible snapshots on a NetApp cyber vault, an air-gapped environment that is logically separated from primary networks and systems. The snapshots cannot be deleted until the retention policy on those snapshots expires. By moving data to a cyber vault, bad actors have no access to the data.
