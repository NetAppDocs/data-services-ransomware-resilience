=== Readiness drill reports

With this release, you can review ransomware attack readiness drill reports. A readiness drill enables you to simulate a ransomware attack on a newly created, sample workload. Then, investigate the simulated attack and recover the sample workload. This feature helps you know that you are prepared in the event of an actual ransomware attack by testing alert notification, response, and recovery processes.
