=== Reporting of unsupported working environments in BlueXP ransomware protection

During the discovery workflow, BlueXP ransomware protection reports more details when you hover over Supported or Unsupported Workloads. This will help you understand why some of your workloads are not discovered by the BlueXP ransomware protection service. 

There are many reasons why the service doesn't support a working environment, for example, the ONTAP version on your working environment could be below the required version. When you hover over an unsupported working environment, a tooltip displays the reason. 

You can view the unsupported working environments during initial discovery, where you can also download the results. You can also view the results of discovery from the *Workload discovery* option in the Settings page.
