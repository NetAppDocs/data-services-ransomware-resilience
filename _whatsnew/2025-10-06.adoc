=== BlueXP ransomware protection is now NetApp Ransomware Resilience
 
BlueXP ransomware protection has been renamed to NetApp Ransomware Resilience. 

=== BlueXP is now NetApp Console
  
The NetApp Console provides centralized management of storage and data services across on-premises and cloud environments at enterprise gradeâ€”delivering real-time insights, faster workflows, and simplified administration.
 
For details on what has changed, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-relnotes/index.html[NetApp Console release notes].

=== Data breach protection 

The process to identify potential security threats from anomalous behavior has changed and is managed entirely in Ransomware Resilience. With data breach protection, you can configure alerts for potential malacious user activity and block users to protect your data.

==== New user role for data breach detection 

To configure data breach protection, you must have a user role with the new Ransomware Resilience data breach administrator role in the NetApp Console. You can view user-level data breach information with the Ransomware Resilience data breach administrator role or the Ransomware Resilience data breach viewer role. For more information, see link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/data-services-ransomware-resilience/rp-reference-roles.html[NetApp Ransomware Resilience role-based access].
