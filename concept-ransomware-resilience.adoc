Ransomware attacks can block access to your data and attackers can ask for ransom in exchange for the release of data or decryption. According to the IDC, it is not uncommon for victims of ransomware to experience multiple ransomware attacks. The attack can disrupt access to your data for anywhere from one day to several weeks.

NetApp Ransomware Resilience is a service that protects your data from ransomware attacks. The service protects application-based workloads of Oracle, MySQL, VM datastores, and file shares on on-premises NAS storage (using the NFS and CIFS protocols) and SAN storage (FC, iSCSI, and NVMe) as well as Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Amazon Web Services, Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Google Cloud, Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Microsoft Azure, and Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP across the NetApp Console. The service backs up data to Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure cloud storage, and NetApp StorageGRID.

== Ransomware Resilience at the data layer
Your security posture typically encompasses multiple layers of defense to protect against a range of cyber threats. 

* *Outermost layer*: This is your first line of defense using firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and virtual private networks to safeguard network boundaries. 
* *Network security*: This layer builds upon the foundation with network segmentation, traffic monitoring, and encryption. 
* *Identity security*: Uses authentication methods, access controls, and identity management to ensure only authorized users can access sensitive resources. 
* *Application security*: Protects software applications using secure coding practices, security testing, and runtime application self-protection. 
* *Data security*: Safeguards your data with data protection, backups, and recovery strategies. Ransomware Resilience operates on this layer.

== What you can do with Ransomware Resilience 

Ransomware Resilience provides full use of several NetApp technologies so that your storage administrator, data security administrator, or security operations engineer can accomplish the following goals:

* *Identify* all application-based, file-share, or VMware-managed workloads in NetApp on-premises NAS (NFS or CIFS) and SAN (FC, iSCSI, and NVMe) systems across the NetApp Console, projects, and Console agents. Ransomwware Resilience categorizes the data priority and provides recommendations to you for ransomware resilience improvements.
// check wording

* *Protect* your workloads by enabling backups, snapshot copies, and ransomware protection strategies on your data.  

* *Detect* anomalies that might be ransomware attacks.footnote:[Although it's possible that an attack might go undetected, our research indicates NetApp technology has resulted in a high degree of detection for certain file encryption-based ransomware attacks.] 

* *Respond* to potential ransomware attacks by automatically initiating a tamper-proof NetApp ONTAP snapshot that is locked so that the copy cannot be deleted accidentally or maliciously. Your backup data will stay immutable and protected end to end from ransomware attacks at the source and in the destination.


* *Recover* your workloads that help accelerate workload uptime by orchestrating several NetApp technologies. You can choose to recover specific volumes. The service provides recommendations on the best options. 

* *Govern*: Implement your ransomware protection strategy and monitor the outcomes.

== Benefits of using Ransomware Resilience 

Ransomware Resilience offers the following benefits: 

* Discovers workloads and their existing snapshot and backup schedules, and ranks their relative importance.
* Evaluates your ransomware protection posture and displays it in an easy-to-understand dashboard.
* Provides recommendations on next steps based on discovery and protection posture analysis. 
* Applies AI/ML-driven data protection recommendations with one-click access.
* Protects data in top application-based workloads, such as MySQL, Oracle, VMware datastores and file-shares. 
* Detects ransomware attacks on data in real time on primary storage using AI technology.
* Initiates automated actions in response to detected potential attacks by creating snapshot copies and initiating alerts about abnormal activity.
* Applies curated recovery to meet RPO policies. Ransomware Resilience orchestrates recovery from ransomware incidents by using several NetApp recovery services, including NetApp Backup and Recovery (formerly Cloud Backup) and SnapCenter. 
* Uses role-based access control (RBAC) to govern access to features and operations in the service, which enhances security. 

//* Applies curated recovery to meet RPO policies. Ransomware Resilience orchestrates recovery from ransomware incidents by using several NetApp recovery services, including Backup and Recovery, SnapCenter, SnapRestore, and AIQ.


== Cost 
NetApp doesn't charge you for using the trial version of Ransomware Resilience. 

NOTE: With the October 2024 release, new deployments of Ransomware Resilience offer a 30-day free trial. Previously, Ransomware Resilience provided a 90-day free trial. If you've enrolled already in the 90-day free trial, that trial is valid for the 90 days.

//NetApp doesn’t charge you for using the trial version of Ransomware Resilience. The full version of Ransomware Resilience can be used with a NetApp license or an AWS subscription.


If you have both Backup and Recovery and Ransomware Resilience, any common data protected by both products is billed by Ransomware Resilience only.

After you purchase a license or PayGo subscription, any workload that has a ransomware detection policy (Autonomous Ransomware Protection) enabled (discovered or set by Ransomware Resilience), and at least one snapshot or backup policy, Ransomware Resilience classifies it "Protected" and it counts against purchased capacity or the PayGo subscription. If a workload is discovered without a detection policy even if it has backup or snapshot policies, it is classified “At risk” and it does _not_ count against purchased capacity. 

Protected workloads count against purchased capacity or the subscription after the 90-day trial period ends. Ransomware Resilience is charged on a per GB basis for the data associated with protected workloads before efficiencies. 

== Licensing 

With Ransomware Resilience, you can use different licensing plans including a free trial, a pay-as-you-go subscription, or bring your own license.

//With Ransomware Resilience, you can use different licensing plans including a free trial, a pay-as-you-go subscription, or bring your own license.

Ransomware Resilience requires a NetApp ONTAP One license. 

//NOTE: The general release of Ransomware Resilience, unlike the Preview release, includes a license for NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection technology. Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/anti-ransomware/index.html[Autonomous Ransomware Protection overview^] for details. 

The Ransomware Resilience license does not include additional NetApp products. Ransomware Resilience can use Backup and Recovery even if you don't have a license for it. 

To detect anomalous user behavior, Ransomware Resilience uses NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection, a machine learning (ML) model within ONTAP that detects malicious file activity. This model is included in the Ransomware Resilience license. You can additionally use Data Infrastructure Insights (formerly Cloud Insights) Workload Security (license required) to investigate user behavior and block specific users from further activity. 

For details, see link:rp-start-licenses.html[Set up licensing].

== How Ransomware Resilience works

Ransomware Resilience uses NetApp Backup and Recovery to discover and set snapshot and backup policies for file share workloads, and SnapCenter or SnapCenter for VMware to discover and set snapshot and backup policies for application and VM workloads. In addition, Ransomware Resilience uses Backup and Recovery and SnapCenter / SnapCenter for VMware to perform file- and workload-consistent recovery.
