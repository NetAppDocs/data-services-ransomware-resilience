[.lead]
NetApp Ransomware Resilience supports detection of suspicious user behavior, enabling you to address ransomware incidents at the user-level. 

NetApp Ransomware Resilience delivers an AI-driven data breach detection by monitoring for suspicious user activity. Sharp increases in read activity as well as read activity access patterns are used to determine malicious intent. Once detected, Ransomware Resilience automatically generates alerts in the NetApp Console, through e-mail, and through any security ecosystem (for example, SIEM).

With suspicious user behavior detection and alerting, Ransomware Resilience alerts you to data breach and destruction attempts and patterns that seem suspicious. In each alert, Ransomware Resilience identifies a user who you can block from the alerts dashboard. You can also create snapshots to use for later restore, stymying ransomware attacks. 

Ransomware Resilience detects suspicious user activity by analyzing user activity events generated by FPolicy in ONTAP. To collect user activity data, you need to deploy one or more user activity agents. The user activity agent is a Linux server or VM with connectivity to devices on your tenant.

== Suspicious user activity forensices

Ransomware Resilience offers forensics for user behaviors: lists and graphs that show when suspicious activity occured and when notifications were sent out. These detail the frequency of suspicious activity on files, directories, volumes, and workloads over time to help chart the events. You can also observe the appearance of new file extensions.

You can compare suspicious activity with a view of all activity. In the all activity view, you can observe read, write, rename, move, create, and delete events in addition to access change and access denied events.

== Components

There are three key components in Ransomware Resilience user behavior activity detection.

* The **user activity agent** is an executable environment for data collectors. You must configure the user activity agent.
* The **data collector** share user activity events with Ransomware Resilience. The data collector is created automatically when you xref:rp-use-protect.adoc#add-a-detection-policy-to-workloads-with-existing-snapshot-and-backup-policies-managed-by-snapcenter-or-backup-and-recovery[enable a ransomware protection strategy with suspicious user activity detection].
* The **user directory connector** enables mapping between usernames and user IDs, creating greater clarity when responding to suspicious user behavior. 

== Workload Security 

User behavior activity detection is an integration with Data Infrastructure Insights Workload Security. You don't need any configurations with DII to enable these features.
