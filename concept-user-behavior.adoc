With user activity detection, NetApp Ransomware Resilience supports enables you to address ransomware events at the user-level, stopping events such as data breaches and large-scale deletion.  

NetApp Ransomware Resilience delivers an AI-driven data breach detection by monitoring for suspicious user activity. Sharp increases in read activity and read activity access patterns are used to determine malicious intent. Once detected, Ransomware Resilience automatically generates alerts in the NetApp Console, via e-mail, and in any configured security ecosystem (for example, SIEM).

With suspicious user behavior detection and alerting, Ransomware Resilience alerts you to data breach and destruction attempts and patterns that seem suspicious. In each alert, Ransomware Resilience identifies a user whom you can block.

Ransomware Resilience detects suspicious user activity by analyzing user activity events generated by FPolicy in ONTAP. To collect user activity data, you need to deploy one or more user activity agents. The user activity agent is a Linux server or VM with connectivity to devices on your tenant.

== Suspicious user activity forensics

Ransomware Resilience offers forensics for user behaviors: lists and graphs that show when suspicious activity occurred and when notifications were sent out. These detail the frequency of suspicious activity on files, directories, volumes, and workloads over time to help chart the events. You can also observe the appearance of new file extensions.

You can compare suspicious activity with a view of all activity. In the all activity view, you can observe read, write, rename, move, create, and delete events in addition to access change and access denied events.

== Components

There are three key components in Ransomware Resilience suspicious user behavior activity detection.

* The **user activity agent** is an executable environment for data collectors. You must configure the user activity agent.
* The **data collector** share user activity events with Ransomware Resilience. The data collector is created automatically when you link:rp-use-protect.html#add-a-detection-policy-to-workloads-with-existing-backup-or-snapshot-policies[enable a ransomware protection strategy with suspicious user activity detection].
* The **user directory connector** enables mapping between usernames and user IDs, creating greater clarity when responding to suspicious user behavior. You must configure the user directory connector. 

== Ransomware Resilience and Data Infrastructure Insights

Ransomware Resilience's suspicious user behavior detection is an integration with Data Infrastructure Insights (DII) Workload Security and uses link:reference-user-activity-requirements.html[DII endpoints]. You don't need any DII configuration to enable user behavior detection in Ransomware Resilience. To enable user behavior detection, link:suspicious-user-activity.html[create the required agent and collectors and enable the appropriate ransomware protection strategy].
