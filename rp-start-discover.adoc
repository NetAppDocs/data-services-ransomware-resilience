[.lead]
Before you can use NetApp Ransomware Resilience, it first needs to discover workload data. During discovery, Ransomware Resilience analyzes all volumes and files in systems across all Console agents and projects within an organization. 

In the Discovery dashboard, Ransomware Resilience displays supported and unsupported system configurations. Ransomware Resilience assesses Oracle applications, VMware datastores, file shares, and block storage. 

[NOTE]
Ransomware Resilience does not discover workloads with volumes using FlexGroup.

Ransomware Resilience checks your current backup protection, snapshot copies, and NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection options. Ransomware Resilience also detects protection information from SnapCenter for VMware for VM datastores, SnapCenter for Oracle, and NetApp Backup and Recovery for file shares and VM file shares. It then recommends ways to improve your ransomware protection.

*How can you discover workloads?*
You can do the following: 

* Within each Console agent, select the systems where you want to discover workloads. You might benefit from this feature if you want to protect specific workloads in your environment and not others. 
//* During workload discovery, you can enable automatic discovery of workloads per Console agent. This feature lets you select the workloads that you want to protect. 
* Discover newly created workloads for previously selected systems. 
* Discover new systems. 

== Select workloads to discover and protect

Within each Console agent, select the systems where you want to discover workloads.

//. Do one of the following: 
//* To select systems for all Console agents, select *Select all systems*.

. To discover workloads for a specific Console agent, select *Select systems* next to the Console agent where you want to discover workloads.



. Select the systems where you want to discover workloads. 
//. Optionally, select *Enable autodiscovery* to have Ransomware Resilience automatically discover new workloads in the selected Console agent. 
. Select *Discover*. 
+
Ransomware Resilience discovers workload data only for Console agents with selected systems. This process can take a few minutes.
. To download the list of discovered workloads, select *Download results*.

. To display the Ransomware Resilience dashboard, select *Go to Dashboard*.   
+
The Dashboard shows data protection health. The number of at-risk or protected workloads updates as new workloads are discovered.

== Discover newly created workloads for previously selected systems

If you have already selected systems for discovery, you can discover newly created workloads for those environments from the Dashboard.

.Steps

. To identify the date of the last discovery, look at the date and time stamp next to *Refresh* icon at the top right of the Ransomware Resilience dashboard.

. From the Dashboard, select the *Refresh* icon to find new workloads. 

== Discover new systems

If you have already discovered systems, you can find new or previously unselected ones.

.Steps

//. Do one of the following: 
//* From the Dashboard, select *Add new* and in the tooltip that appears, select *Add new systems*. 
. From the Ransomware Resilience menu, select the vertical image:button-actions-vertical.png[Vertical Actions]... option at the top right. From the drop-down menu, select *Settings*. 

. In the Workload discovery card, select *Discover workloads*. Discovery can take a few minutes. A loading icon displays the progress. 
. Ransomware Resilience discovers both supported and unsupported systems. It does not support a system if its ONTAP version is below the required version. When you hover over an unsupported system, a tooltip displays the reason. Select the systems where you want to discover workloads. 
. Select *Discover*.

== Exclude workloads 

Ransomware Resilience allows you to exclude specific workloads in a systems if you don't want them include in your ransomware detection and protection scheme. You can only exclude workloads that are supported and have been discovered successfully. 

You aren't billed for workloads excluded from Ransomware Resilience. 

.Exclude workloads

. In Ransomware Resilience, select **Settings**. 
. In the Settings dashboard, locate the Workload discovery dashboard. The card identifies the number of excluded workloads. Next to the excluded workloads, select **Manage**.
+

+
. In the Excluded workloads page, select **Add**. 
. Select the workloads you want to exclude. 
. Select **Add**. 
. Review the excluded workloads in the Excluded workloads page. While the workload is being added, a progress indicator displays next to its name. If a workload was not excluded successfully, it doesn't display on the page. 

.Re-include workloads 
. In Ransomware Resilience, select **Settings**. 
. In the Settings dashboard, locate the Workload discovery dashboard. The card identifies the number of excluded workloads. Next to the excluded workloads, select **Manage**.
