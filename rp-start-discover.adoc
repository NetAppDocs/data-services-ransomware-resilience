[.lead]
Before you can use NetApp Ransomware Resilience, it first needs to discover workload data. During discovery, Ransomware Resilience analyzes all volumes and files in systems across all Console agents and projects within an organization. 

In the Discovery dashboard, Ransomware Resilience displays supported and unsupported system configurations. Ransomware Resilience assesses Oracle applications, VMware datastores, file shares, and block storage. 

[NOTE]
Ransomware Resilience does not discover workloads with volumes using FlexGroup.

Ransomware Resilience checks your current backup protection, snapshot copies, and NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection options. Ransomware Resilience also detects protection information from SnapCenter for VMware for VM datastores, SnapCenter for Oracle, and NetApp Backup and Recovery for file shares and VM file shares. It then recommends ways to improve your ransomware protection. 

[IMPORTANT]
Although Ransomware Resilience recognizes policies from SnapCenter, you can't perform recovery through SnapCenter with Ransomware Resilience.

//. Do one of the following: 
//* To select systems for all Console agents, select *Select all systems*.

. To discover workloads for a specific Console agent, select *Select systems* next to the Console agent where you want to discover workloads.



. Select the systems where you want to discover workloads. 
//. Optionally, select *Enable autodiscovery* to have Ransomware Resilience automatically discover new workloads in the selected Console agent. 
. Select *Discover*. 
+
Ransomware Resilience only discovers workload data when you select system. The discovery process can take several minutes. 
. To download the list of discovered workloads, select *Download results*.
. To display the Ransomware Resilience dashboard, select *Go to Dashboard*.   
+
The Dashboard shows data protection health. The number of at-risk or protected workloads updates as new workloads are discovered.

== Discover newly created workloads for previously selected systems

If you've added workloads to a previously discovered system, you need to reinitiate discovery to protect the new workloads. 

.Steps

. To identify the time of the last discovery, look at the date and time stamp next to *Refresh* icon at the top right of the Ransomware Resilience dashboard.

. From the Dashboard, select the *Refresh* icon to find new workloads. 

[TIP]
If you find there are volumes not displaying for the system you've discovered, the volumes might be unsupported. To find a list of unsupported volumes, go to the **Settings** menu then select the action menu in the Workload discovery card to download a JSON report of supported and unsupported volumes. 

== Discover new systems

If you have already discovered systems, you can find new or previously unselected ones.

.Steps

//. Do one of the following: 
//* From the Dashboard, select *Add new* and in the tooltip that appears, select *Add new systems*. 
. From the Ransomware Resilience menu, select the vertical image:button-actions-vertical.png[Vertical Actions]`...` option at the top right. From the drop-down menu, select *Settings*. 

. In the Workload discovery card, select *Discover workloads*. Discovery can take a few minutes. A loading icon displays the progress. 
. Ransomware Resilience discovers both supported and unsupported systems. It does not support a system if its ONTAP version is below the required version. When you hover over an unsupported system, a tooltip displays the reason. Select the systems where you want to discover workloads. 
. Select *Discover*.

== Exclude workloads 

Ransomware Resilience allows your to exclude specific workloads in a system from ransomware protection and detection. 

You can only exclude workloads that are supported and have been discovered successfully. You can modify the list of excluded workloads at any time. You aren't billed for workloads excluded from Ransomware Resilience. 

.Add workloads to the excluded workloads list
. In Ransomware Resilience, select **Settings**. 
. In the Settings dashboard, locate the Workload discovery dashboard. The card identifies the number of excluded workloads. To add workloads, next to the excluded workloads, select **Manage**.
+

+
. In the Excluded workloads page, select **Add**. 
. Select the workloads you want to exclude then **Add**. 
. Review the excluded workloads in the Excluded workloads page. While the workload is being added, a progress indicator displays next to its name. If a workload was not excluded successfully, it doesn't display on the page. 

.Remove workloads from the excluded workload list
. In Ransomware Resilience, select **Settings**. 
. In the Settings dashboard, locate the Workload discovery dashboard. The card identifies the number of excluded workloads. Next to the excluded workloads, select **Manage**.
