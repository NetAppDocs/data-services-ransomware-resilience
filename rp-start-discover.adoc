[.lead]
To use BlueXP ransomware protection, the service needs to first discover data. During discovery, BlueXP ransomware protection analyzes all volumes and files in working environments across all BlueXP Connectors and projects within an organization. 

*Required BlueXP role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin role. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

*What does the service discover?*
BlueXP ransomware protection assesses MySQL applications, Oracle applications, VMware datastores, and file shares. 

NOTE: The service does not discover workloads with volumes that use FlexGroup or iSCSI.

BlueXP ransomware protection discovers and displays both supported and unsupported working environment configurations in the Dashboard.

The service checks your current backup protection, snapshot copies, and NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection options. It then recommends ways to improve your ransomware protection. 

*How can you discover workloads?*
You can do the following: 

* Within each Connector, select the working environments where you want to discover workloads. You might benefit from this feature if you want to protect specific workloads in your environment and not others. 
//* During workload discovery, you can enable automatic discovery of workloads per Connector. This feature lets you select the workloads that you want to protect. 
* Discover newly created workloads for previously selected working environments. 
* Discover new working environments. 


== Select workloads to discover and protect
Within each Connector, select the working environments where you want to discover workloads. 

.Steps

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 
+
If this is your first login, the landing page appears.

NOTE: If you started the free trial, the *Start 30-day free trial* button label changes to *Start by discovering workloads*. 

. From the initial landing page, select *Start by discovering workloads*. 
+
The service finds both supported and unsupported working environments. This process might take a few minutes.
+

//. Do one of the following: 
//* To select working environments for all Connectors, select *Select all working environments*.

. To discover workloads for a specific Connector, select *Select  working environments* next to the Connector where you want to discover workloads.



. Select the working environments where you want to discover workloads. 
//. Optionally, select *Enable autodiscovery* to have BlueXP ransomware protection automatically discover new workloads in the selected Connector. 
. Select *Discover*. 
+
The service discovers workload data only for those Connectors with selected working environments. This process might take a few minutes.
+

. To download the list of discovered workloads, select *Download results*.

. To display the BlueXP ransomware protection Dashboard, select *Go to Dashboard*.   
+
The Dashboard shows data protection health. The number of at-risk or protected workloads updates as new workloads are discovered.

== Discover newly created workloads for previously selected working environments

If you have already selected working environments for discovery, you can discover newly created workloads for those environments from the Dashboard.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 

. To identify the date of the last discovery, from the Dashboard, look at the date and time stamp next to *Refresh* icon at the top right.

. From the Dashboard, select the *Refresh icon* to find new workloads. 


== Discover new working environments

If you have already discovered working environments, you can find new or previously unselected ones.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 
//. Do one of the following: 
//* From the Dashboard, select *Add new* and in the tooltip that appears, select *Add new working environments*. 
. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select the vertical image:button-actions-vertical.png[Vertical Actions]... option at the top right. From the drop-down menu, select *Settings*. 

. In the Workload discovery card, select *Discover workloads*.
+
TIP: This process might take a few minutes, and a loading icon shows the progress.
. The service discovers both supported and unsupported working environments. The service does not support a working environment if its ONTAP version is below the required version. When you hover over an unsupported working environment, a tooltip displays the reason. Select the working environments where you want to discover workloads. 

. Select *Discover*.

//== Enable automatic discovery of workloads per Connector

//After you set up the first workload discovery, you can set up automatic discovery of workloads per Connector.

//.Steps

//. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 
//+
//The Dashboard appears. 
//+
//image:screen-dashboard.png[BlueXP ransomware protection Dashboard]

//. From the top right of the Dashboard, select *Discover workloads*. 

//. Locate a Connector that displays the *Find new working environments* link.  
//+
//image:screen-discover-workloads-newly-discovered.png[Newly discovered working environments screenshot]

//. Select *Enable autodiscovery* to have BlueXP ransomware protection automatically discover new workloads in the selected Connector. 

//. Select *Discover*. 

//== Set up email notifications 

//You can send specific types of notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when you’re not logged into BlueXP. Emails can be sent to any users who are part of your BlueXP organization, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of certain types of system activity.

//NOTE: Sending email notifications is not supported when the Connector is installed in a site without internet access.

//By default, BlueXP Organization admins will receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" notifications. 

//For instructions on configuring email settings, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-monitor-cm-operations.html#set-email-notification-settings[Configure email settings in BlueXP^]
