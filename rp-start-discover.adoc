[.lead]
Before you can use NetApp Ransomware Resilience, it needs to first discover data. During discovery, Ransomware Resilience analyzes all volumes and files in systems across all Console agents and projects within an organization. 

*Required Console role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin role. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about Console access roles for all services^].

*What does the service discover?*
Ransomware Resilience assesses MySQL applications, Oracle applications, VMware datastores, file shares, and block storage. 

NOTE: The service does not discover workloads with volumes that use FlexGroup.

Ransomware Resilience discovers and displays both supported and unsupported system configurations in the Dashboard.

The service checks your current backup protection, snapshot copies, and NetApp Autonomous Ransomware Protection options. It then recommends ways to improve your ransomware protection. 

*How can you discover workloads?*
You can do the following: 

* Within each Console agent, select the systems where you want to discover workloads. You might benefit from this feature if you want to protect specific workloads in your environment and not others. 
//* During workload discovery, you can enable automatic discovery of workloads per Console agent. This feature lets you select the workloads that you want to protect. 
* Discover newly created workloads for previously selected systems. 
* Discover new systems. 


== Select workloads to discover and protect
Within each Console agent, select the systems where you want to discover workloads.

//. Do one of the following: 
//* To select systems for all Console agents, select *Select all systems*.

. To discover workloads for a specific Console agent, select *Select systems* next to the Console agent where you want to discover workloads.



. Select the systems where you want to discover workloads. 
//. Optionally, select *Enable autodiscovery* to have Ransomware Resilience automatically discover new workloads in the selected Console agent. 
. Select *Discover*. 
+
The service discovers workload data only for those Console agents with selected systems. This process might take a few minutes.

== Discover newly created workloads for previously selected systems

If you have already selected systems for discovery, you can discover newly created workloads for those environments from the Dashboard.

.Steps

. To identify the date of the last discovery, look at the date and time stamp next to *Refresh* icon at the top right of the Ransomware Resilience dashboard.

. From the Dashboard, select the *Refresh icon* to find new workloads. 


== Discover new systems

If you have already discovered systems, you can find new or previously unselected ones.

.Steps

//. Do one of the following: 
//* From the Dashboard, select *Add new* and in the tooltip that appears, select *Add new systems*. 
. From the Ransomware Resilience menu, select the vertical image:button-actions-vertical.png[Vertical Actions]... option at the top right. From the drop-down menu, select *Settings*. 

. In the Workload discovery card, select *Discover workloads*.
+
TIP: This process might take a few minutes, and a loading icon shows the progress.
. The service discovers both supported and unsupported systems. The service does not support a system if its ONTAP version is below the required version. When you hover over an unsupported system, a tooltip displays the reason. Select the systems where you want to discover workloads. 

. Select *Discover*.

//== Enable automatic discovery of workloads per Console agent

//After you set up the first workload discovery, you can set up automatic discovery of workloads per Console agent.

//.Steps

//. From the top right of the Dashboard, select *Discover workloads*. 

//. Locate a Console agent that displays the *Find new systems* link.  
//+
//image:screen-discover-workloads-newly-discovered.png[Newly discovered systems screenshot]

//. Select *Enable autodiscovery* to have Ransomware Resilience automatically discover new workloads in the selected Console agent. 

//. Select *Discover*. 

//== Set up email notifications 

//You can send specific types of notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when youâ€™re not logged into the Console. Emails can be sent to any users who are part of your Console organization, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of certain types of system activity.

//NOTE: Sending email notifications is not supported when the Console agent is installed in a site without internet access.

//By default, Console organization admins will receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" notifications. 

//For instructions on configuring email settings, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-monitor-cm-operations.html#set-email-notification-settings[Configure email settings^]
