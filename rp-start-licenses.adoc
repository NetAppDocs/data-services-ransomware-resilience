[.lead]
With NetApp Ransomware Resilience, you can use different licensing plans.

*Required Console role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin role. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about Console access roles^].

*License types*
You can use the following license types:

* Sign up for a 30-day free trial.
* Purchase a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) subscription with Amazon Web Services (AWS) Marketplace, Google Cloud Marketplace, or Azure Marketplace. 
* Bring your own license (BYOL), which is a NetApp License File (NLF) that you obtain from your NetApp Sales Rep. You can use the license serial number to get the BYOL activated in the Console. 
//NOTE: Ransomware Resilience charges are based on provisioned capacity of datastores on the source site when there is at least one VM that has a replication plan. Capacity for a failed over datastore is not included in the capacity allowance. For a BYOL, if the data exceeds the allowed capacity, operations in the service are limited until you obtain an additional capacity license, upgrade the license in the Console Licenses and subscriptions page, or purchase a subscription in AWS. If you choose an AWS subscription, any capacity used above the contract limits is charged based on the AWS Marketplace plans. 

After you set up your BYOL or purchase a PAYGO subscription, you can see the license in the Licenses and subscriptions section of the Console.

After the free trial ends or the license or subscription expires, you can still do the following in the service:

* View workloads and workload health.
* Delete any resource, such as a policy.
* Run all scheduled operations that were created during the trial period or under the license. 

== Other licenses  

The Ransomware Resilience license does not include additional NetApp products. Ransomware Resilience can use NetApp Backup and Recovery even if you don't have a license for it. 

NOTE: If you have both Bakup and Recovery and Ransomware Resilience, any common data protected by both products will be billed by Ransomware Resilience only. 

You can view anomalous user behavior with Data Infrastructure Insights Workload Security. This requires a license for Data Infrastructure Insights Workload Security and that you enable it in Ransomware Resilience. For an overview of Data Infrastucture Insights Workload Security, review https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/data-infrastructure-insights/cs_intro.html[About Workload Security^]

TIP: If you don't have a license for Data Infrastructure Insights Workload Security and don't enable it in Ransomware Resilience, you won't see the anomalous user behavior information. 

== Try it out using a 30-day free trial
You can try Ransomware Resilience out by using a 30-day free trial. You must be an Console Organization administrator to start the free trial. 


NOTE: With the October 2024 release, new deployments of Ransomware Resilience now have 30 days for a free trial. Previously, Ransomware Resilience provided 90 days as a free trial. If you are already in the 90-day free trial, that offer continues for the 90 days.

No capacity limits are enforced during the trial.  

You can get a license or subscribe at any time and you will not be charged until the 30-day trial ends. To continue after the 30-day trial, you'll need to purchase a BYOL license or PAYGO subscription. 

During the trial, you have full functionality.
