You can easily deploy NetApp Ransomware Resilience. Before you begin, review link:rp-start-prerequisites.html[prerequisites] to ensure that your environment is ready.

== Prepare the backup destination 

Prepare one of the following backup destinations: 

* NetApp StorageGRID
* Amazon Web Services 
* Google Cloud Platform
* Microsoft Azure 

After you configure options in the backup destination itself, you will later configure it as a backup destination in Ransomware Resilience. For details about how to configure the backup destination in Ransomware Resilience, refer to link:rp-use-settings.html[Configure backup destinations].

=== Prepare StorageGRID to become a backup destination

If you want to use StorageGRID as your backup destination, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-117/index.html[StorageGRID documentation^] for details about StorageGRID. 


=== Prepare AWS to become a backup destination
 
* Set up an account in AWS.
* Configure https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions.html[AWS permissions^] in AWS. 
 

For details about managing your AWS storage in the Console, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-viewing-amazon-s3.html[Manage your Amazon S3 buckets^].


=== Prepare Azure to become a backup destination
 
* Set up an account in Azure.
* Configure https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-permissions.html[Azure permissions^] in Azure. 
 

For details about managing your Azure storage in the Console, refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-blob-storage/task-view-azure-blob-storage.html[Manage your Azure storage accounts^].


== Set up the NetApp Console
The next step is to set up the Console and Ransomware Resilience. 

Review https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-quick-start-standard-mode.html[Console requirements for standard mode^].


=== Create a Console agent

Contact your NetApp Sales Rep to try out or use this service. Then, when you use the Console agent, it will include the appropriate capabilities for Ransomware Resilience. 

To create a Console agent using Ransomware Resilience, contact your Console organization admin who has permissions to create Console agents, and refer to the documentation that describes https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloud-manager-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[how to create a Console agent^]. 

NOTE: If you have multiple Console agents, the Ransomware Resilience scan datas across all Console agents beyond the one that currently shows in the Console. This service discovers all projects and all Console agents associated with this organization. 



//== Set up email notifications 

//You can send specific types of notifications by email so you can be informed of important system activity even when youâ€™re not logged into the Console. Emails can be sent to any users who are part of your the Console organization, or to any other recipients who need to be aware of certain types of system activity.

//NOTE: Sending email notifications is not supported when the Connector is installed in a site without internet access.

//By default, Console Organization admins will receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" notifications. 

//For instructions on configuring email settings, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-monitor-cm-operations.html#set-email-notification-settings[Configure email settings in the Console^]
