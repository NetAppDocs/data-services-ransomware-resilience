Run a ransomware attack readiness drill by simulating an attack on a new sample workload. Investigate the simulated attack and recover the workload. Use this feature to test alert notifications, response, and recovery. Run the drill as often as needed.

TIP: Your real workload data is not impacted. 

You can run readiness drills on NFS and CIFS (SMB) workloads. 

== Configure a ransomware attack readiness drill
Before you run a simulation, set up a drill on the Settings page. Access the Settings page from the Actions option in the top menu.

You need to enter a user name and password for the following situations: 

* If user name or password changes occurred for the previously selected storage VM
* If you select a different CIFS (SMB) storage VM
* If you enter a different test workload name

. Do the following: 
.. Select the Console agent you want to use for the readiness drill.
.. Select a test system. 
.. Select a test storage SVM. 
.. If you selected a CIFS (SMB) storage VM, **User name** and **Password** fields appear. Enter the user name and password for the storage VM.
.. Enter the name of a new test workload to be created. Do not include dashes in the name. 

. Select *Save*.
//+ 
//A message appears that the readiness drill environment is configured. In that message, select *Start readiness drill* to start the drill.

TIP: You can edit the readiness drill configuration later using the Settings page. 

== Start a readiness drill 

After you configure the readiness drill, you can start the drill.

include::_include/console-role-admin.adoc[]

When you start the readiness drill, Ransomware Resilience skips the learning mode and starts the drill in active mode. The detection status of the workload is Active.

TIP: A workload can have a ransomware detection *Learning mode* status when a detection policy is recently assigned and Ransomware Resilience scans workloads.

.Steps 

. Do one of the following: 

* From the Ransomware Resilience menu, select the *Run readiness drill* button at the top right.
+
image:screen-dashboard.png[Dashboard page showing the Run readiness drill button]
+
* OR, from the Settings page, in the Readiness drill card, select *Start*.
//. Do one of the following:
//* If you haven't already configured the readiness drill, a message appears that you first need to configure the readiness drill.
//+
//image:screen-settings-alert-drill-needtoconfigure.png[Settings page showing the readiness drill message that you need to configure the readiness drill]
//+
//** Select *Configure readiness drill test environment*. 
//** Continue with the instructions in the previous section to configure the drill test environment in the Settings option.

. If you already configured the readiness drill, after selecting *Start*, the readiness drill begins.  
//+

NOTE: After the drill has started, you cannot edit the readiness drill configuration. You can reset it to start again. 

//== Clean up and stop a readiness drill 

//If you need to stop a readiness drill, you can do so at any time. When you stop the drill, Ransomware Resilience cleans up the test workload and removes the test files.

//.Steps


//** From the Ransomware Resilience Settings menu, hover over the Edit option in the Readiness drill tile and select *Clean up readiness drill*.

//. From the Ransomware Resilience menu, select the vertical image:button-actions-vertical.png[Vertical Actions]... option at the top right and select *Clean up readiness drill*.
//+
//image:screen-settings-alert-drill-cleanup.png[Settings page showing the readiness drill stop option]
//+
//NOTE: You can also stop or clean up a readiness drill from the Settings page showing the Readiness drill card. 

//. Review the workload readiness drill information. 
//. Select *Clean up*. 


== Respond to a readiness drill alert
Test your readiness by responding to a readiness drill alert.

include::_include/console-role-admin.adoc[]

.Steps
//. Do one of the following: 

. From the Ransomware Resilience menu, select *Alerts*.
//+
//* Or, from the menu, select the *Notifications* icon, select *View alert* next to the readiness drill alert.
//+
+
The Console displays the Alerts page. In the Alert ID column, you see "Readiness drill" next to the ID.

. Select the alert with the "Readiness drill" indication. A list of incident alerts appears on the Alerts details page.  
+
image:screen-alerts-readiness-details.png[Alerts details page showing the readiness drill alert]
. Review the alert incidents. 

. Select an alert incident. 
+
image:screen-alerts-readiness-incidents2.png[Incident page showing the readiness drill alert]


Here are some things to look for:

* Look at the Potential attack Severity. 
+
If the Severity indicates that a user is suspected of malicious activity, review the user name. You might want to investigate the user more in Data Infrastructure Insights Workload Security by selecting *Investigate in Workload security*. 

//** You might want to block the user by selecting *Block user*. 

* Look at the file activity and suspected processes: 
** Look at the incoming detected data compared to the expected data. 
** Look at the creation rate of files that is detected compared to the expected rate.
** Look at the file renaming rate that is detected compared to the expected rate.
** Look at the deletion rate compared to the expected rate.

* Look at the list of impacted files. Look at the extensions that might be causing the attack. 
* Determine the impact and breadth of the attack by reviewing the number of impacted files and directories.

== Restore the test workload

After reviewing the readiness drill alert, restore the test workload if needed.

include::_include/console-role-admin.adoc[]

.Steps
. Return to the Alert details page. 
. If the test workload should be restored, do the following: 
** Select *Mark restore needed*. 
** Review the confirmation, and select *Mark restore needed* in the confirmation box. 
* From the Ransomware Resilience menu, select *Recovery*. 
* Select the test workload marked with "Readiness drill" that you want to restore.
* Select *Restore*.
* In the Restore page, provide information for the restore: 
** Select the source snapshot copy.
** Select the destination volume.

. In the restore Review page, select *Restore*.
+
The Console displays the status of the Readiness drill restore as "In progress" on the Recovery page.
+
After the restore is complete, the Console changes the status of the workload to *Restored*.
. Review the restored workload. 

TIP: For details about the restore process, see link:rp-use-recover.html[Recover from a ransomware attack (after incidents are neutralized)].  

== Change the Alerts status after the readiness drill

After reviewing the readiness drill alert and restoring the workload, change the alert status if needed.

*Required the Console role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware Resilience admin. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about Console access roles for all services^].

.Steps
. Return to the Alert details page.
. Select the alert again. 

. Indicate the status by selecting *Edit status* and change the status to one of the following: 

** Dismissed: If you suspect that the activity is not a ransomware attack, change the status to Dismissed. 
+
IMPORTANT: After you dismiss an attack, you cannot chanage it back. If you dismiss a workload, all snapshot copies taken automatically in response to the potential ransomware attack will be permanently deleted. If you dismiss the alert, the readiness drill is considered complete.

** Resolved: The incident has been mitigated. 


== Review reports on the readiness drill
After the readiness drill is complete, you might want to review and save a report on the drill.

include::_include/console-role-admin-viewer.adoc[]
