summary: The NetApp Ransomware Resilience Dashboard provides information about the protection health of your workloads. You can quickly determine workloads that are at risk or protected, impacted workloads impacted by an incident or in recovery, and gauge the extent of protection by looking at how much storage is protected or at risk. You can also use the Dashboard to review and act on protection recommendations.

The NetApp Ransomware Resilience Dashboard provides at-a-glance information about the protection health of your workloads. You can quickly determine workloads that are at risk or protected, identify workloads impacted by an incident or in recovery, and gauge the extent of protection by looking at how much storage is protected or at risk.  

Use the Dashboard to review protection suggestions, change settings, download reports, and view documentation.

== Review workload health using the Dashboard

.Steps

. After the Console discovers your workloads, the Ransomware Resilience dashboard displays workload data protection health.
+

. From the Dashboard, you can do the following actions in each of the panes: 

* *Workload data protection*: Select *View all* to see all workloads that are at risk or protected on the Protection page. Workloads are at risk when protection levels don't match a protection policy. Refer to link:rp-use-protect.html[Protect workloads].  
+
TIP: Select the "i" tooltip to see tips on this data. To increase the workload limit, select *Increase workload limit* inside this i note. Selecting this takes you to the Console Support page where you can create a case ticket. 

* *Alerts and workload data recovery*: Select *View all* to see active incidents that have impacted your workload, are ready for recovery after incidents are neutralized, or are in recovery. Refer to link:rp-use-alert.html[Respond to a detected alert]. 
+
** An incident is categorized in one of the following states: 
+
*** New
*** Dismissed
*** Dismissing
*** Resolved
+ 
** An alert can have one of the following statuses:

*** New 
*** Inactive

** A workload can have one of the following restore statuses: 

*** Restore needed
*** In progress
*** Restored
*** Failed


* *Recommended actions*: To increase protection, review each recommendation then select *Review and fix*. 
+
See link:rp-use-dashboard.html#review-protection-recommendations-on-the-dashboard[Review protection suggestions on the Dashboard] or link:rp-use-protect.html[Protect workloads]. 
+
Ransomware Resilience displays new recommendations since your last visit to the Dashboard with the "New" tag for 24 hours. Actions appear in priority order, with the most important at the top. Review, act on, or dismiss each recommendation.
+
The total number of actions does not include actions you dismissed. 

* *Workload data*: Monitor changes in protection coverage over the last 7 days. 

* *Workload backups*: Monitor changes in workload backups created by Ransomware Resilience that failed or completed successfully in the last 7 days. 

== Review protection recommendations on the Dashboard

Ransomware Resilience assesses the protection on your workloads and recommends actions to improve that protection. 

You can review a recommendation and act on it, which changes the recommendation status to Complete. Or, if you want to act on it later, you can dismiss it. Dismissing an action moves the recommendation to a list of dismissed actions, which you can review later. 

Here is a sampling of the recommendations that Ransomware Resilience offers.

[cols=3*,options="header",cols="30,30,30",width="100%"]
|===
| Recommendation
| Description
| How to resolve


| Add a ransomware protection policy. | The workload is currently not protected.  | Assign a policy to the workload. 
Refer to link:rp-use-protect.html[Protect workloads against ransomware attacks].
//|Edit workload name. | Your workloads are using default names. | Give your workload a descriptive name.
//Refer to link:rp-use-manage.html[Manage workloads].
//|Keep software up to date. | Your ONTAP version on all nodes is not up to date. | Make your protection stronger against ransomware by keeping software up to date. 
|Connect to SIEM for threat reporting. | Send data to a security and event management system (SIEM) for threat analysis and detection. | Enter SIEM/XDR server details to enable threat detection. 
Refer to link:rp-use-settings.html[Configure protection settings].
//|Enable threat detection. | Send data to a security and event management system (SIEM) or extended detection and response (XDR) server for threat analysis and detection. | Enter SIEM/XDR server details to enable threat detection. 

|Enable workload-consistent protection for applications or VMware. | These workloads are not managed by SnapCenter Software or SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere. | To have them managed by SnapCenter, enable workload-consistent protection. 
Refer to link:rp-use-protect.html[Protect workload against ransomware attacks].
|Improve security posture for system | NetApp Digital Advisor has identified at least one high or critical security risk. | Review all security risks in NetApp Digital Advisor. 
Refer to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/active-iq/index.html[Digital Advisor documentation^].
|Make a policy stronger. | Some workloads might not have enough protection. Strengthen protection on workloads with a policy. | Increase retention, add backups, enforce immutable backups, block suspicious file extensions, enable detection on secondary storage and more.
Refer to link:rp-use-protect.html[Protect workloads against ransomware attacks].
| Prepare <backup provider> as a backup destination to back up your workload data. | The workload does not currently have any backup destinations. | Add backup destinations to this workload to protect it. 
Refer to link:rp-use-settings.html[Configure protection settings].| Protect critical or highly important application workloads against ransomware. | The Protect page displays critical or highly important (based on the Priority level assigned) application workloads that are not protected. | Assign a policy to these workloads. 
Refer to link:rp-use-protect.html[Protect workloads against ransomware attacks].
| Protect critical or highly important file share workloads against ransomware. |The Protection page displays critical or highly important workloads of the type File Share or Datastore that are not protected. | Assign a policy to each of the workloads.
Refer to link:rp-use-protect.html[Protect workloads against ransomware attacks].
| Register available SnapCenter plugin for VMware vSphere (SCV) with the Console | A VM workload is not protected. | Assign  VM-consistent protection to the VM workload by enabling the SnapCenter Plugin for VMware vSphere. 
Refer to link:rp-use-protect.html[Protect workloads against ransomware attacks].
| Register available SnapCenter Server with the Console | An application is not protected. | Assign application-consistent protection to the workload by enabling SnapCenter Server. 
Refer to link:rp-use-protect.html[Protect workloads against ransomware attacks].
| Review new alerts. | New alerts exist. | Review the new alerts. 
Refer to link:rp-use-alert.html[Respond to a detected ransomware alert].
