[.lead]
Within the BlueXP ransomware protection service, you can use BlueXP classification to scan and classify the data in a file share workload. Classifying data helps you determine whether the dataset includes personally identifiable information (PII), which can increase security risks. BlueXP classification is a core component of the BlueXP family and is available at no additional cost. 

link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-classification/[BlueXP classification^] utilizes AI-driven natural language processing for contextual data analysis and categorization, providing actionable insights into your data to address compliance requirements, detect security vulnerabilities, optimize costs, and accelerate migration.

//IMPORTANT: BlueXP classification can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud (non-SaaS deployments), or as a SaaS model in a technology Preview. When using non-SaaS deployments or existing deployments, scanning for PII data in BlueXP ransomware protection is generally available and not in Preview. To enable Preview features, use the BlueXP ransomware protection *Settings* option. Refer to link://rp-use-settings-html[Configure BlueXP ransomware protection settings].

TIP: This process can impact workload importance to help ensure you have the appropriate protection. 

*Required BlueXP role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin role. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

== Identify privacy exposure with BlueXP classification 

Before you use BlueXP classification within the BlueXP ransomware protection service, you need link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-classification/task-deploy-cloud-compliance.html[to enable BlueXP classification to scan your data^].

You can deploy BlueXP classification within the Protection page of the BlueXP ransomware protection service. Follow the procedure to identify the privacy exposure. When you select **Identify exposure**, if you haven't already deployed BlueXP classification, a dialog enables you to enable BlueXP classification.

//TIP: You do this only once; you don't have to enable BlueXP classification again if you choose another file share workload on which to identify exposure.

.Before you begin

Scanning for PII data in BlueXP ransomware protection is available if you've link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-classification/task-deploy-cloud-compliance.html[deployed BlueXP classification^]. BlueXP classification is available as part of the BlueXP platform at no extra charge and can be deployed on-premises or in the customer cloud.

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.

. In the Protection page, locate a file share workload in the Workload column. 
+
image:screen-protection-sensitive-preview-column.png[Protection page showing Privacy exposure column]

. To enable BlueXP classification to scan your data for PII, in the *Privacy exposure* column, select *Identify exposure*. 

[NOTE]
If you haven't deployed BlueXP classification, selecting *Identify exposure* opens a dialog to deploy BlueXP classification. Select *Deploy*. After you've deployed BlueXP classification, you can return to the Protection page then select *Identify exposure*.

.Result

//For the SaaS version of BlueXP classification, BlueXP classification installs a BlueXP Connector, remotely connects to your workload data and scans it in the NetApp cloud (Amazon Web Services, us-west-1). Only identified insights and metrics remain in the NetApp cloud. 

Scanning can take several minutes depending on the size and number of the files. During the scan, the Protection page indicates it is identifying files and provides a file count. When scanning is complete, the Privacy exposure column rates the exposure level as Low, Medium, or High.  

== Review the privacy exposure

After BlueXP classification scans for PII, assess the risk. 

PII data is classified into one of three designations:   

* *High*: Greater than 70% of files contain PII
* *Medium*: Greater than 30% and less than 70% of files contain PII
* *Low*: Greater than 0% and less than 30% of files contain PII

.Steps

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select *Protection*.
. In the Protection page, locate the file share workload in the Workload column that shows a status in the Privacy exposure column. 
+
image:screen-protection-sensitive-preview-column-medium.png[Protection page showing Privacy exposure column]
//+
//TIP: If the status changes, an up or down arrow appears in the Privacy exposure column to indicate the Privacy exposure change. 

. Select the workload link in the Workload column to see workload details. 
+
image:screen-protection-workload-details-privacy-exposure.png[Workload details screen showing the Privacy exposure tile]
. In the Workload details page, look at the details in the Privacy exposure tile. 
//+
//TIP: If the privacy exposure change affects the workload importance, an up or down arrow appears next to the Workload Importance status.  

== Impact of privacy exposure on workload importance

Privacy exposure changes can impact the workload importance.
