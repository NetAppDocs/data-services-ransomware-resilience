= Scan for personally identifiable information with NetApp Data Classification in NetApp Ransomware Resilience

:hardbreaks:
:icons: font

[.lead]
Within the NetApp Ransomware Resilience, you can use NetApp Data Classification to scan and classify the data in a file share workload. Classifying data helps you determine whether the dataset includes personally identifiable information (PII), which can increase security risks. Data Classification is a core component of the Console and is available at no additional cost. 

link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-classification/[Data Classification^] utilizes AI-driven natural language processing for contextual data analysis and categorization, providing actionable insights into your data to address compliance requirements, detect security vulnerabilities, optimize costs, and accelerate migration.

//IMPORTANT: Data Classification can be deployed on-premises, in the cloud (non-SaaS deployments), or as a SaaS model in a technology Preview. When using non-SaaS deployments or existing deployments, scanning for PII data in Ransomware Resilience  is generally available and not in Preview. To enable Preview features, use the Ransomware Resilience  *Settings* option. Refer to link://rp-use-settings-html[Configure Ransomware Resilience  settings].

TIP: This process can impact workload importance to help ensure you have the appropriate protection. 

*Required Console role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin role. link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about Console access roles for all services^].

== Identify privacy exposure with Data Classification 

Before you use Data Classification within Ransomware Resilience, you need link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-classification/task-deploy-cloud-compliance.html[to enable Data Classification to scan your data^].

You can deploy Data Classification within the Protection page of Ransomware Resilience . Follow the procedure to identify the privacy exposure. When you select **Identify exposure**, if you haven't already deployed Data Classification, a dialog enables you to enable Data Classification.

//TIP: You do this only once; you don't have to enable Data Classification again if you choose another file share workload on which to identify exposure.

.Before you begin

Scanning for PII data in Ransomware Resilience  is available if you've link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-classification/task-deploy-cloud-compliance.html[deployed Data Classification^]. Data Classification is available as part of the Console at no extra charge and can be deployed on-premises or in the customer cloud.

.Steps

. From the Ransomware Resilience  menu, select *Protection*.

. In the Protection page, locate a file share workload in the Workload column. 
+
image:screen-protection-sensitive-preview-column.png[Protection page showing Privacy exposure column]

. To enable Data Classification to scan your data for PII, in the *Privacy exposure* column, select *Identify exposure*. 

[NOTE]
If you haven't deployed Data Classification, selecting *Identify exposure* opens a dialog to deploy Data Classification. Select *Deploy*. After you've deployed Data Classification, you can return to the Protection page then select *Identify exposure*.

.Result

//For the SaaS version of Data Classification, Data Classification installs a Console agent, remotely connects to your workload data and scans it in the NetApp cloud (Amazon Web Services, us-west-1). Only identified insights and metrics remain in the NetApp cloud. 

Scanning can take several minutes depending on the size and number of the files. During the scan, the Protection page indicates it is identifying files and provides a file count. When scanning is complete, the Privacy exposure column rates the exposure level as Low, Medium, or High.  

== Review the privacy exposure

After Data Classification scans for PII, assess the risk. 

PII data is classified into one of three designations:   

* *High*: Greater than 70% of files contain PII
* *Medium*: Greater than 30% and less than 70% of files contain PII
* *Low*: Greater than 0% and less than 30% of files contain PII

.Steps

. From the Ransomware Resilience  menu, select *Protection*.
. In the Protection page, locate the file share workload in the Workload column that shows a status in the Privacy exposure column. 
+
image:screen-protection-sensitive-preview-column-medium.png[Protection page showing Privacy exposure column]
//+
//TIP: If the status changes, an up or down arrow appears in the Privacy exposure column to indicate the Privacy exposure change. 

. Select the workload link in the Workload column to see workload details. 
+
image:screen-protection-workload-details-privacy-exposure.png[Workload details screen showing the Privacy exposure tile]
. In the Workload details page, look at the details in the Privacy exposure tile. 
//+
//TIP: If the privacy exposure change affects the workload importance, an up or down arrow appears next to the Workload Importance status.  

== Impact of privacy exposure on workload importance

Privacy exposure changes can impact the workload importance.

//== Investigate privacy exposure directly in Data Classification

//From within Ransomware Resilience , you can select a workload, view its details, and then investigate the exposure in Data Classification.

//.Steps

//. From the Ransomware Resilience  menu, select *Protection*.

//. In the Protection page, locate the file share workload in the Workload column that shows a status in the Privacy exposure column.

//. In the Workload details page, review the information in the Privacy exposure tile. 

//. To investigate the exposure in Data Classification, select *Investigate*.
