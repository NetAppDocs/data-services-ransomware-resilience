After workloads have been marked "Restore needed", NetApp Ransomware Resilience recommends a recovery point actual (RPA) and orchestrates the workflow for a crash-resistant recovery. 

* If the application or VM is managed by SnapCenter, Ransomware Resilience restores the application or VM back to its previous state and last transaction using the application-consistent or VM-consistent process. The application or VM-consistent restore adds any data that did not make it into storage, for example, data in cache or in an I/O operation, to the data in the volume. 

* If the application or VM is _not_ managed by SnapCenter and is managed by NetApp Backup and Recovery or Ransomware Resilience, Ransomware Resilience performs a crash-consistent restore, where all the data that was in the volume at the same point of time is restored, for example, if the system crashed. 
+
You can restore the workload by selecting all volumes, specific volumes, or specific files. 

TIP: Workload recovery can impact running workloads. You should coordinate recovery processes with the appropriate stakeholders. 

A workload can have one of the following restore statuses: 

* *Restore needed*: The workload needs to be restored. 
* *In progress*: The restore operation is currently underway. 
* *Restored*: The workload has been restored. 
* *Failed*: The workload restore process could not be completed.

== Restore a workload managed by SnapCenter 

Using Ransomware Resilience, the storage administrator can determine how best to restore workloads either from the recommended restore point or the preferred restore point. 

The application state will change if required for the restore. The application will be restored to its previous state from control files, if they are included in the backup. After the restore finishes, the application opens in READ-WRITE mode.

== Restore a workload not managed by SnapCenter

Using Ransomware Resilience, the storage administrator can determine how best to restore workloads either from the recommended restore point or the preferred restore point.  

*Required Console role*
Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about Console access roles for all services^].

The security storage admin can recover data at different levels: 

* Recovery all volumes 
* Recover an application at the volume level or file and folder level. 
* Recover a file share at the volume level, directory, or file/folder level. 
* Recover from a datastore at a VM level.

The process differs depending on the workload type.

+
** All volumes 
** By volume
** By file: You can specify a folder or single files to restore.

=== Restore an application workload at the file level

Before you restore an application workload at the file level, you can view a list of impacted files. You can access the Alerts page to download a list of impacted files. Then use the Recovery page to upload the list and choose which files to restore. 

You can restore an application workload at the file level to the same or different system.

.Steps to get the list of impacted files

Use the Alerts page to retrieve the list of impacted files.

//Alert tab -> Single alert -> Single incident -> Download file

. From the Ransomware Resilience menu, select *Alerts*.
. On the Alerts page, sort the results by workload to show the alerts for the application workload that you want to restore. 
. From the list of alerts for that workload, select an alert. 
. For that alert, select a single incident. 
+
