[.lead]
You can configure backup destinations, send data to an external security and event management (SIEM) system, conduct an attack readiness drill, configure workload discovery, or configure suspicious user activity detection by accessing the *Settings* option. 

include::_include/console-role-admin.adoc[]

//You can also show future Preview features. 

//Enabling threat detection automatically sends data to a security and event management system (SIEM) or extended detection and response (XDR) server for threat analysis and detection. 

*What can you do in the Settings page?*
From the Settings page, you can do the following: 

* Simulate a ransomware attack by conducting a readiness drill and respond to a simulated ransomware alert. For details, see link:rp-start-simulate.html[Conduct a ransomware attack readiness drill].

* Configure workload discovery.
* Configure suspicious user activity reporting.
* Add a backup destination.
* Connect your security and event management system (SIEM) for threat analysis and detection. Enabling threat detection automatically sends data to your SIEM for threat analysis.  
//* Show upcoming Technology Preview features.



== Access the Settings page directly

You can easily access the Settings page from the Actions option near the top menu. 

. From the Ransomware Resilience, select the vertical image:button-actions-vertical.png[Vertical Actions]... option at the top right. 
. From the drop-down menu, select *Settings*.

== Simulate a ransomware attack

Conduct a ransomware readiness drill by simulating a ransomware attack on a newly created, sample workload. Then, investigate the simulated attack and recover the sample workload. This feature helps you know that you are prepared in the event of an actual ransomware attack by testing alert notification, response, and recovery processes. You can run a ransomware readiness drill multiple times. 

For details, refer to link:rp-start-simulate.html[Conduct a ransomware attack readiness drill].

== Configure workload discovery 

You can configure workload discovery to automatically discover new workloads in your environment.

. In the Settings page, locate the *Workload discovery* tile.
. In the *Workload discovery* tile, select *Discover workloads*.
+
This page shows Console agents with systems that were not selected earlier, newly available Console agents, and newly available systems. This page doesn't show those systems that were previously selected. 

. Select the Console agent where you want to discover workloads.
. Review the list of systems.
. Check the systems where you want to discover workloads or select the box at the top of the table to discover workloads in all discovered workload environments.
. Do this for other systems as needed.

. Select *Discover* to have Ransomware Resilience automatically discover new workloads in the selected Console agent.

[TIP]
From the Workload discovery card in Settings, select the action menu `...` then **Download report (JSON)** to review a list of supported and unsupported workloads in your systems. 

== Suspicious user activity

In the User activity card, you can create and manage the user activity agent that is required to detect suspicious user activity.

For more information, see link:suspicious-user-activity.html[Suspicious user activity].

== Add a backup destination

Ransomware Resilience can identify workloads that do not have any backups yet and also workloads that do not have any backup destinations assigned yet. 

To protect those workloads, you should add a backup destination. You can choose one of the following backup destinations: 

* NetApp StorageGRID
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform
* Microsoft Azure 

NOTE: Backup destinations are not available for workloads in Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP nor Azure NetApp Files. Perform backup operations using native backup solutions: FSx for ONTAP backup service or Azure NetApp Files backupss. 

You can add a backup destination based on a recommended action from the Dashboard or from accessing the Settings option on the menu. 

=== Access Backup Destination options from the Dashboard's recommended actions

The Dashboard provides many recommendations. One recommendation might be to configure a backup destination. 

.Steps


. In the Ransomware Resilience dashboard, review the Recommended actions pane. 
+
image:screen-dashboard.png[Dashboard page]

. From the Dashboard, select *Review and fix* for the recommendation of "Prepare <backup provider> as a backup destination."

. Continue with instructions depending on the backup provider. 

=== Add StorageGRID as a backup destination

To set up NetApp StorageGRID as a backup destination, enter the following information. 

.Steps
. In the *Settings > Backup destinations* page, select *Add*. 
. Enter a name for the backup destination. 
+
image:screen-settings-backup-destination.png[Backup destinations page]

. Select *StorageGRID*.
. Select the down arrow next to each setting and enter or select values: 
* *Provider settings*:
** Create a new bucket or bring your own bucket that will store the backups. 
** StorageGRID gateway node fully qualified domain name, port, StorageGRID access key and secret key credentials.
* *Networking*: Choose the IPspace. 
** The IPspace is the cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside. The intercluster LIFs for this IPspace must have outbound internet access. 
//* *Backup lock*: Choose whether you want Ransomware Resilience to protect backups from being modified or deleted. This option uses the NetApp DataLock technology. Each backup will be locked during the retention period, or for a minimum of 30 days, plus a buffer period of up to 14 days. 
//June 20, 2024 we do not support Azure and StorageGrid backup locking
//+
//CAUTION: If you configure the backup lock setting now, you cannot change the setting later after the backup destination is configured. 
//+
//** *Governance mode*: Specific users (with `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission) can overwrite or delete protected files during the retention period. 
//** *Compliance mode*: Users cannot overwrite or delete protected backup files during the retention period. 
. Select *Add*.
