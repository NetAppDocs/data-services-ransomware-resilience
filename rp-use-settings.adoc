[.lead]
You can configure backup destinations, enable threat detection, conduct an attack readiness drill, configure workload discovery, or configure connection to Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security by accessing the *Settings* option. 


//You can also show future Preview features. 

//Enabling threat detection automatically sends data to a security and event management system (SIEM) or extended detection and response (XDR) server for threat analysis and detection. 

From the Settings page, you can do the following: 

* Simulate a ransomware attack by conducting a readiness drill and respond to a simulated ransomware alert. For details, see link:rp-start-simulate.html[Conduct a ransomware attack readiness drill].

* Configure workload discovery.

* Configure the connection to Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security to see suspected user information in ransomware alerts.  

* Add a backup destination.
* Enable threat detection and connect your security and event management system (SIEM) for threat analysis and detection. Enabling threat detection automatically sends data to your SIEM for threat analysis.   
//* Show upcoming Technology Preview features.

*Required BlueXP role*

Organization admin, Folder or project admin, or Ransomware protection admin role. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

== Access the Settings page directly

You can easily access the Settings page from the Actions option near the top menu. 

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection menu, select the vertical image:button-actions-vertical.png[Vertical Actions]... option at the top right. 
. From the drop-down menu, select *Settings*.

== Simulate a ransomware attack

Conduct a ransomware readiness drill by simulating a ransomware attack on a newly created, sample workload. Then, investigate the simulated attack and recover the sample workload. This feature helps you know that you are prepared in the event of an actual ransomware attack by testing alert notification, response, and recovery processes. You can run a ransomware readiness drill multiple times. 

For details, refer to link:rp-start-simulate.html[Conduct a ransomware attack readiness drill].

== Configure workload discovery 

You can configure workload discovery to automatically discover new workloads in your environment.

. In the Settings page, locate the *Workload discovery* tile.
. In the *Workload discovery* tile, select *Discover workloads*.
+
This page shows BlueXP Connectors with working environments that were not selected earlier, newly available BlueXP Connectors, and newly available working environments. This page doesn't show those working environments that were previously selected. 

. Select the Connector where you want to discover workloads.
. Review the list of working environments.
. Check the working environments where you want to discover workloads or select the box at the top of the table to discover workloads in all discovered workload environments.
. Do this for other working environments as needed.

. Select *Discover* to have BlueXP ransomware protection automatically discover new workloads in the selected Connector.


== See suspected anomalous user behavior by connecting to Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security 

Before you can view details of suspected anomalous user behavior in BlueXP ransomware protection, you need to configure the connection to the Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security system.

=== Obtain an API access token from the Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security system

Obtain an API access token from the Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security system.

. Log in to the Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security system.
. From the left navigation, select *Admin* > *API Access*.
+
image:../media/screen-alerts-ci-api-access-token.png[API Access page in Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security] 

. Either create an API access token or use an existing one.
. Copy the API access token.

=== Connect to Data Infrastructure Insights Workload security

. From the BlueXP ransomware protection Settings menu, locate the *Workload security connection* tile.
. Select *Connect*.
. Enter the URL for the Data Infrastructure Workload security UI.
. Enter the API access token that provides access to Workload security. 
. Select *Connect*.



== Add a backup destination

BlueXP ransomware protection can identify workloads that do not have any backups yet and also workloads that do not have any backup destinations assigned yet. 

To protect those workloads, you should add a backup destination. You can choose one of the following backup destinations: 

* NetApp StorageGRID
* Amazon Web Services (AWS)
* Google Cloud Platform
* Microsoft Azure 

NOTE: Backup destinations are not available for workloads in Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP. Perform backup operations using the FSx for ONTAP backup service. 

You can add a backup destination based on a recommended action from the Dashboard or from accessing the Settings option on the menu. 

=== Access Backup Destination options from the Dashboard's recommended actions

The Dashboard provides many recommendations. One recommendation might be to configure a backup destination. 

.Steps


. From the BlueXP left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware protection*. 

. Review the Dashboard's Recommended actions pane. 
+
image:screen-dashboard.png[Dashboard page]

. From the Dashboard, select *Review and fix* for the recommendation of "Prepare <backup provider> as a backup destination."

. Continue with instructions depending on the backup provider. 




=== Add StorageGRID as a backup destination

To set up NetApp StorageGRID as a backup destination, enter the following information. 

.Steps
. In the *Settings > Backup destinations* page, select *Add*. 
. Enter a name for the backup destination. 
+

. Select *StorageGRID*.
. Select the Down arrow next to each setting and enter or select values: 
* *Provider settings*:
** Create a new bucket or bring your own bucket that will store the backups. 
** StorageGRID gateway node fully qualified domain name, port, StorageGRID access key and secret key credentials.
* *Networking*: Choose the IPspace. 
** The IPspace is the cluster where the volumes you want to back up reside. The intercluster LIFs for this IPspace must have outbound internet access. 
//* *Backup lock*: Choose whether you want the service to protect backups from being modified or deleted. This option uses the NetApp DataLock technology. Each backup will be locked during the retention period, or for a minimum of 30 days, plus a buffer period of up to 14 days.  
//June 20, 2024 we do not support Azure and StorageGrid backup locking
//+
//CAUTION: If you configure the backup lock setting now, you cannot change the setting later after the backup destination is configured. 
//+
//** *Governance mode*: Specific users (with `s3:BypassGovernanceRetention` permission) can overwrite or delete protected files during the retention period. 
//** *Compliance mode*: Users cannot overwrite or delete protected backup files during the retention period. 
. Select *Add*.
