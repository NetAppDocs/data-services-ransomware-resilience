Ransomware Resilience supports detection of suspicious user behavior in detection policies, enabling you to address ransomware incidents at the user-level. 

Ransomware Resilience detects suspicious user activity by analyzing user activity events generated by FPolicy in ONTAP. To collect user activity, you need to deploy one or more user activity agent. The agent is a Linux server or VM with connectivity to devices on your tenant.

== Agents and collectors

At least one user activity agent must be installed to activate suspicious user activity detection in Ransomware Resilience. When you activate the suspicious user activity feature from Ransomware Resilience dashboard, you need to provide the agent host information to activate the feature.

An agent can host multiple data collectors. Data collectors send data to a SaaS location for analysis. There are two types of collectors:

* the **data collector** collects user activity data from ONTAP.
* the **user directory collector** connects to your directory to map user IDs to usernames.

Collectors are configured in the Ransomware Resilience settings.

=== Add a user activity agent 

User activity agents are executable environments for data collectors to share data with Ransomware Resilience. You must create at least one user activity agent to enable suspicious user activity detection. 

.Steps
. In Ransomware Resilience, go to *Settings*.
. Locate the User activity card. If this is your first time creating a user activity agent, select **Activate**.
+
If you're adding a new user activity agent, select **Manage**. On the User activity screen, select the **User activity agents** tab then **Add**.
. Select the **User activity agent** tab then select **Add**. 
. In the dialog, provide:
  * **User activity agent name**
  * *Console agent* 
  * *VM DNS name or IP address* 
  * *VM SSH Key*
+

. Select **Next**.
. Review your settings. Select *Authenticate VM* to complete adding the user activity agent. 
. Confirm the user activity agent was successfully created. In the User activity card, a successful deployment displays as Running.

.Result
After the user activity agent is successfully created, return to the **Settings** menu then select **Manage** in the User activity card. Select the **User activity agent** tab then select the user activity agent to view details about it including data collectors and user directory connectors. 

=== Add a data collector 

Data collectors are created automatically when you enable a ransomware protection strategy with suspicious user activity detection. For more information, see xref:rp-use-protect.html#add-a-detection-policy-to workloads-with-existing-backup-or-snapshot-policies [add a detection policy].

You can view the details of the data collector menu. From Settings, select **Manage** in the User activity card. Select the **Data collector** tab then select the data collector to view its details.

=== Add a user directory connector

To map user IDs to user names, you must create a user directory connector. 

.Steps 
. In Ransomware Resilience, go to *Settings*.
. In the User activity card, select **Manage**.
. Select the **User directory connectors** tab then **Add**.
. Provide the details of the connection:
  * *Name*
  * *User directory type*
  * *Server IP address or domain name*
  * *Forest name or search name*
  * *BIND domain name*
  * *BIND password*
  * *Protocol* (this is optional)
  * *Port*
+

+
Provide the attribute mapping:
  * *Display name*
  * *SID* (if you're using LDAP)
  * *User name* 
  * *Unix ID* (if you're using NFS)
  * Select *Include optional attributes*. You can also include email address, telephone number, role, state, country, department, photo, manager DN, or groups. 
+
Select *Advanced* to add an optional search query. 
. Select **Add**. 
. Return to the user directory connectors tab to check the status of your user directory connector. If created successfully, the status of the user directory connector displays as *Running*. 

=== Delete a user directory connector

. In Ransomware Resilience, go to *Settings*.
. Locate the User activity card, select **Manage**.
. Select the **User directory connector** tab.
. Identify the user directory connector you want to delete. In the action menu at the end of the line, select the three dots `...` then **Delete**.
. In the pop-up dialog, select **Delete** to confirm your actions. 

=== Delete a user activity agent

. In Ransomware Resilience, go to *Settings*.
. Locate the User activity card, select **Manage**.
. Select the **User activity agent** tab.
. Identify the user activity agent you want to delete. In the action menu at the end of the line, select the three dots `...` then **Delete**.
. In the pop-up dialog, select **Delete** to confirm your actions. 


== Respond to suspicious user activity alerts

After you configure suspicious user activity detection, you can monitor events in the alerts page. For more information, see link:rp-use-alert.html#detect-malicious-activity-and-anomalous-user-behavior[Detect malicious activity and anomalous user behavior].
