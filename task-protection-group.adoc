NetApp Ransomware Resilience offers protection groups to facilitate easier management of your data estate. Protection groups are logical groupings of workloads. Ransomware Resilience can protect all volumes in a protection group at the same time with a single protection strategy, sparing you from applying a strategy to each workload.
