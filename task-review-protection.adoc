NetApp Ransomware Resilience's protection dashboard provides an overview of the protection status and readiness of your workloads. Use the protection dashboard to gain insights into what is protected, what needs protection, and what the scope of the protection is. 

Once you understand the scope of your current protection, link:rp-use-protect.html[you can create and apply ransomware protection strategies to your workloads].

== View protection on a workload

One of the first steps in protecting workloads is viewing your current workloads and their protection status. You can see the following types of workloads: 

* Application workloads 
* Block workloads
* File share workloads
* VM workloads

.Steps 

. From the Console's left navigation, select *Protection* > *Ransomware Resilience*. 
. Do one of the following: 
+
* From the Data Protection pane on the dashboard, select *View all*. 
* From the menu, select *Protection*.
+

. From this page, you can view and change protection details for the workload.

NOTE: See link:rp-use-protect.html#add-a-ransomware-protection-strategy[Add a ransomware protection strategy] to learn about using Ransomware Resilience when there's an existing protection policy with Backup and Recovery.

== Understand the protection dashboard

The protection dashboard in Ransomware Resilience displays detailed information about workloads (for example, workload name and type, Console agent, system, and storage VM) in addition to insights about protection status. Use the protection dashboard to review and manage ransomware preparedness for workloads. The following columns are especially helpful in understanding your protection posture:

*Protection status*: A workload can show one of the following protection statuses to indicate whether a policy is applied or not: 

* *Protected*: A policy is applied. ARP (or ARP/AI depending on the ONTAP version) is enabled on all volumes related to the workload. 
* *At risk*: No policy is applied. If a workload does not have a primary detection policy enabled, it is "at risk" even if it has a snapshot and backup policy enabled. 
* *In progress*: A policy is being applied but not completed yet. 
* *Failed*: A policy is applied but is not working. 

*Detection status*:
+
Ransomware Resilience provides insights into the scope of ransomware detection policies you've configured on your workloads. Review the detection scope with the following fields. 

** *Encryption detection status*
** *Suspected user behavior detection status*
** *Block suspicious file extensions*

*Snapshot, replication, and backup policies*: This column shows the product or service that is managing the policy. If there's no policy, the field displays N/A.

*Importance*

Ransomware Resilience assigns an importance or priority to each workload during discovery based on an analysis of each workload. The workload importance is determined by the following snapshot frequencies: 

* *Critical*: More than one snapshot copy is taken per hour (highly aggressive protection schedule)
* *Important*: Snapshots copies are created less frequently than every hour but more frequently than every day 
* *Standard*: Snapshot copies are taken more than once per day

*Privacy exposure*: Select this option to link:task-classify.html[scan for personally identifiable information with NetApp Data Classification].

*Replication destination*: If you've configured snapshot replication, the names of the destination storage VMs and systems are listed. If there's no replication, this field displays "N/A."

*Backup destination*: If you've configured a ransomware protection strategy with backups, the name of the backup destination system is listed here.
