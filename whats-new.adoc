=== Threat detection with Splunk Cloud

You can automatically send data to your security and event management system (SIEM) for threat analysis and detection. With previous releases, you could select only the AWS Security Hub as your SIEM. With this release, you can select the AWS Security Hub or Splunk Cloud as your SIEM. 

//For details, refer to link:rp-use-settings.html[Configure BlueXP ransomware protection settings].

=== Restore application workload at the file level 
Before you restore an application workload at the file level, you can now view a list of files that might have been impacted by an attack and identify those you want to restore. You can let BlueXP ransomware protection choose the files to restore, you can upload a CSV file that lists all the files impacted by an alert, or you can manually identify which files you want to restore. 

NOTE: With this release, if all BlueXP Connectors in an account are not using Podman, the single file restore feature is enabled. Otherwise, it is disabled for that account.

//With this release, you can restore application workloads at the file level to the original source working environment and create a new path inside the volume if you want or to a different working environment.

=== Download a list of impacted files
Before restoring an application workload at the file level, you can now access the Alerts page to download a list of impacted files in a CSV file and then use the Recovery page to upload the CSV file.

The BlueXP ransomware protection service is a SaaS solution for protecting data, detecting potential attacks, and recovering data from a ransomware attack. 

For the preview version, the service protects application-based workloads of Oracle, MySQL, VM datastores, and file shares on on-premises NAS storage as well as Cloud Volumes ONTAP on AWS (using the NFS protocol) across BlueXP organizations individually and backs up data to Amazon Web Services cloud storage. 

The BlueXP ransomware protection service provides full use of several NetApp technologies so that your data security administrator or security operations engineer can accomplish the following goals:

* View ransomware protection on all your workloads at a glance.
* Gain insight into ransomware protection recommendations
* Improve protection posture based on BlueXP ransomware protection recommendations.
* Assign ransomware protection policies to protect your top workloads and high-risk data against ransomware attacks.
* Monitor the health of your workloads against ransomware attacks looking for data anomalies.
* Quickly assess the impact of ransomware incidents on your workload. 
* Recover from ransomware incidents intelligently by restoring data and ensuring that reinfection from stored data does not occur.
